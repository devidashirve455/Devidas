\subsection*{Purpose}
\vspace{4mm}
\begin{enumerate}

The purpose of an online shopping program is to revolutionize and simplify the process of purchasing goods and services through digital platforms. It offers unparalleled convenience, allowing customers to shop from virtually anywhere at any time, eliminating the need for physical store visits. This accessibility extends the reach of businesses, breaking down geographical boundaries and connecting them to a global audience. With comprehensive product information, price comparisons, and secure payment options, it empowers customers to make informed decisions and find the best deals. For businesses, online shopping programs facilitate efficient inventory management, data collection, and marketing strategies, ultimately creating a dynamic marketplace that enhances the customer experience and expands market reach while reducing overhead costs.
